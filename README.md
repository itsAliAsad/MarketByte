## 🟣 Executive Summary

**MarketByte** (Code Name: _PSX-Brief_) is an AI-driven "Financial Co-Pilot" that lives inside WhatsApp. Our mission is to transform "blind" retail investors into informed wealth-builders by delivering personalized, jargon-free market intelligence that connects abstract indices to their daily lives.

In a market where retail investors often panic-sell due to a lack of context, **MarketByte** provides a frictionless bridge between complex financial data and actionable insights.

> **"From panic-selling to data-driven confidence."**

## 🟣 The Problem: "Blind" Investing

Retail investors in Pakistan, especially Mutual Fund/SIP holders, face significant challenges:

- 📉 **Panic Selling**: They see fund balances drop and react emotionally without understanding the "why".
- 😵 **Information Overload**: Existing tools are either too complex (Bloomberg terminals) or too generic/spammy (broad news sites).
- 📵 **Lack of Context**: News is rarely filtered by what the user actually _owns_.

---

## 🟣 The Solution: Personalized Intelligence

**MarketByte** is a frictionless WhatsApp bot that filters daily market news based on the user's actual portfolio.

- **Smart Filtering**: Connects market movements directly to the user's holdings.
- **Plain Language**: Explains "why" in simple English/Urdu.
- **Data-Driven**: Highlights undervalued opportunities using real-time data, not rumors.
